I am looking for study buddies in doing ossu cs education. Please feel free to leave a message or contact me (id:asterora) on discord. 

My life offered me some lows that made me quit programming a few times. This time I am taking it slow and I wanna make the process enjoyable. This learning might take a lifetime. 

During daytime I work as a researcher. My job doesn't require coding. Programming and handcrafting are my other passions outside work.
